Most previous studies conducted the identification experiments for two to ten authors. But in the online context, reviews to be identified usually have more potential authors, and normally classification algorithms are not adapted to large number of target classes. To examine the robustness of classification algorithms, we identified 50 of the most active users (represented by a unique ID and username) who frequently posted reviews in these newsgroups. The number of reviews we collected for each author is 30.\n\nAttribute Information:\n \nattribution includes authors' linguistic style such as usage of digit, punctuation, words and sentences' length and usage frequency of words and so on",
